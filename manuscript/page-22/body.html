<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Occupants</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Lafayette visited the Hammond-Harwood House, and it was a favorite meeting place of the planter society of Maryland. Through the years it has been lived in and loved by the prominent 4 Maryland families of Pinkney, Chase, Loockerman and Harwood. The Harwoods owned and lived in the house for some 75 years before it became a museum, thus the hyphenated name Hammond-Harwood explains and completes the beginning and end of its private ownership.</p></div> </div>
